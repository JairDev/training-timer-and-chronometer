![Alt Text](screenshot/apptra.png)

My first javascript project !

- Mode chronometer
   * You can start, stop, restart and reset the chronometer.

- Mode training
   * You can configure how many training cycles you need.
   * You can set rest time and work time.
   * Alert sound at the end of a cycle.
